# static_page
## How to set free github page to be my homepage.
1. Create a repository and contain all of the codes inside.
2. Go to `Settings` tab.
3. Go to `Pages` and select `Source = Branch: main`
4. We can configure a new domain name following to this [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPGi1IHQxFM).
5. Other than the domain name to pay, we can find free domain name from [here](https://www.freenom.com/).
6. But now my domain is [https://atthana.github.io/static_page/](https://atthana.github.io/static_page/).

### Reminder: 
- In domain name we have to use default as `https://atthana.github.io/<repo_name>/`. <br>So we have to configure the repo name that convery to what you want to tell.
- In my local repo will use `static_page` which is not same name as `homepage` in remote repo.
- Right now I used Bootstrap sample from [here](https://startbootstrap.com/template/sb-admin) need to customize later.
